KD-Tree
=======
As k-dimension tree, it speeds up searching within the k-dimension space.
This is a demo for searching nearest neighbour within 2 dimensions.

Use random2d to generate some random points, say 1 million.
Then pipe those points into tree2d and find one of the points within
(-10.0, -10.0) to (10.0, 10.0) range. The demo do the search 1000 times
to amplify the speedup for searching when you have a deep tree.
